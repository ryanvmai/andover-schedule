# Ideas to consider or things I would like to see added:
1. Include the approximate amount of time it takes to complete a homework assignment. Also, include the amount of time for classes. Thus, you can perhaps display how much time a person has to commit to work for that specific day.
2. Come up with a system to coordinate classes and other extracurricular activities. Maybe a color coordinated system.
3. Could this auto-sync with Canvas? Perhaps Canvas has a developer API? Something worth looking into!
